Matheo? 
I've seen him half an hour ago.
He was runing around the benches...
Sorry, I don't know anything else.

Oh, you're concerned about the guy with the hat?
Don't worry, Stubi is actually an invited guest.
You see, he loves the thrill of the adventure...
So yeah, sneaking through bushes, climbing trees,
that's very normal for him. We have a bet going.
I want to see how many presents he can steal from
the party. He gives them back, of course.

Renna's aunt? She's such a sweetheart, right?
Sometimes she intimidates me a bit, if I'm being honest...

title: James.UncleMickey

Mickey is amazing. He did so much for the wedding.
And we went through a list of about three hundred dishes
together and decided what would be on the buffet.
He knew more about that stuff than me, and I'm half-chinese.

Oh, I want to make dumplings with Renna sometime.
I think she'll really like it!
But vegan ones, hahaha.
My mom would kill me for saying that. 
She thinks meat is the most important thing in a dumpling.
There are vegan versions of dumplings though.

Hahahaha. The guy over there?
He looked so lost. Was looking for his date!
He mistook almost everyone here for his date.
I guess the person had no profile image and 
also a pretty gender neutral name? ...
He tried it with *both* Renna and me.
That guy should be more careful, or else
he might get kidnapped if he's that trusting.
