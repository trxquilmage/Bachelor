Oh, everything here is great.
There is a carrot cream soup over there,
here we have the salad. There's pizza.
If you want to live more classy, we have 
fish and wine right over there.
And of course, the greatest one of all:
the dessert is right over here.

    Oh, vegan options, huh?
    You should try the salad then.
    Let's see... what else.
    The wine, obviously.
    And don't forget to try the...
    Never mind, the soup isn't vegan.
    Oh, that must suck for you, 
    I'll ask the caterer, if I see them.
<<else>>
    Great news, I talked to the caterer.
    The soup is vegan, too!
    And so is the pizza apparently.
    It's vegan salami, that's so thoughtful!

The Creme Brulee? A true classic.
I actually convinced James to order this.
It's the thing the catering does best!

Ohh, the pizza is so very good.
I just had another slice. 
But be careful, it's really spicy!

Don't try the fish without the wine!
I think it's monkfish, but I'll have 
to ask the caterer again, if I see them.
