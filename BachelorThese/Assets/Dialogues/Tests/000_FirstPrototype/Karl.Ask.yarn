    Do you like the town? Be straight, Yes or No?

    <<if $likesMayfair is true>>
        Wonderful! Mayfair truly is a beautiful piece of land.
    <<else>>
        Okay. Wow, that kind of hurt my feelings.

    <<if $likesMayfair is true>>
        Do you want to know more about this wonderful place?
        I actually cant think of ANYTHING else about Mayfair.
    <<else>>
        Why? 
        Did you change your mind about our beautiful Mayfair?
