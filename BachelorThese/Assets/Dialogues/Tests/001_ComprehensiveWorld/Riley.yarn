The victim is a woman named Evelyn Garland.
She was stabbed in her house yesterday.
The investigation has only stared today,
so we don't know that much yet.
I'd first recommend questioning the suspects,
that were near her at the time. 
I will follow you around, to aid in your 
investigations, if you don't mind.
