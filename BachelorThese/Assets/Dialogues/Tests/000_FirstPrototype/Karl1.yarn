Its not as much of a special place as Grandrun, but we manage.
Have you passed through Neverre or Borealis on your way here?

    Oh, you're from the east? I hear there is a big conflict going on there, right?
    [[Karl.Explain]]
<<elseif $origin eq "North">>
    That's far up in the north, isnt it? Is it cold up there?
    [[Karl.Explain]]
<<elseif $origin eq "South">>
    Ah, a sunny town in the south, how lovely.

So you're new here, right? Let me show you around town.
We have a tavern, a tree and this road we are standing on this very second, buddy.
