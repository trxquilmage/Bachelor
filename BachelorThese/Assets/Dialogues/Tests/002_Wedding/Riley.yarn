A wedding in the woods is a bit unusual, no?
But I really like it.
The Buffet looks really great too!
We should definetly check that out later.

So. That weird guy over there at the benches... 
The one with the hat...?
Are you sure he belongs here...?
Back when I was waiting on you, I saw him like...
sneak in through the bushes...?
<<displaypromptmenu Managers GenAAA>>
Is he a guest here at the party?
<<set $isGuest to react("value", "", "Riley")>>
<<if $isGuest eq true>>
    Oh, good. I was really worried. 
    He looks like some kind of fancy burglar.
    You know? Like from a cartoon.
<<else>>
    ... That doesn't sound too good?
    Should we tell someone? Bride or Groom maybe?

So, are you guys related?
<<set $related to react("value", "", "Riley")>>

    Okay, no pressure.
    Meeting all your relatives on our first date,
    that's a brutal way to start a relationship.
<<else>>
    Phew, I was scared there for a second.
    Meeting all your relatives on our first date, would
    have been a brutal way to start a relationship.

Hi! Uh... Sorry...
You're the fifth person I'm asking.
Did you invite me to this wedding?
Via err... a dating app?

<<displaypromptmenu Managers GenAAA>>
Yes or no - Are we on a date?
<<set $hasDate to react("value", "hasDate", "Riley")>>
<<if $hasDate eq true>>
    Oh, thank god.
    People were starting to stare.
    I don't want to keep you from going in,
    so I will just follow you, okay?
    Talk to me whenever you want.
    <<settocompanion Managers Riley>>
<<else>>
    Oh, okay, then...
    I promise, I'm not like. A wedding crasher.
    Or like. Loitering.

Oh, okay. No answer then.
<<onnodecomplete Managers>>
This has to be here so the dialogue doesnt end otherwise the dialogue will be over before the command is done and that causes problems.
