My mom? She should be around here somewhere.
Usually when we go somewhere, 
she's close to where the music is.

The DJ? I wanted to talk to him,
He seemed annoyed with me..
He was reading his email instead of working.
So uh, I had a look...
He was texting Jordan, I think?
It didn't seem like wedding buisness.
Interesting email for sure.

Oh ho ho! You wanna know about the email? 
Let me tell you. It sounded so secretive.
Like. If I understood it right, they even
made out a secret word. Like a code word.
But I couldn't read fast enough, to see
the actual word in the mail. But I got far
enough to see, that the secret word is 
the name of DJ's favorite dish!
Come on, admit it! You're really impressed 
with my insane spying skills!

There is a basket with food here,
the present from Jordan though...
I looked into it. I think it's an official paper,
that states, that James and Renna own a boat...
He got them a boat!
And the DJ got them a party hat! How cool is that?
