Greygate, hm? 
<<displaypromptmenuask Managers GenAAA>>
Have you ever been there?
<<set $beenToGreygate to react("value", "", "Riley")>>
<<if $beenToGreygate is true>>
    Oh, you have? It's quite the amazing city.
    I go there at least once a year to visit
    my younger brother. He lives near the 
    market terraces, so it's usually a great
    expierience. An expensive one, too, though.
    If you go again you should ride in one of
    the cable cars. They've been installed all
    over town in the recent years.
<<else>>
    You haven't, then? You should definetly go!
    What I can recommend most is going to 
    visit the market terrace. It's a multi-level
    district filled with shops, restaurants,
    auctions and stalls. Like they say you can
    buy everything there - and it's very true.

My family is from Glomure, but some moved to 
different cities. My brother lives in the capital,
my father still lives in Glomure, together with 
my grandmother. And I have a lot of distant relatives
all over the country. 
We're like, not a very wealthy family.

Me? I'm Riley, Detective from Glomure, 
which is two towns over, if you don't know.
Hm... also I'm 31 years old and I think
this is my fifth year working here.
It's my first murder case, too.
Oh but you wanted to know about me,
not about the case, right?
I grew up in Glomure and still have
family over there. 
People usually expect that I'm married,
but I'm not.
Haven't found the right person yet.
