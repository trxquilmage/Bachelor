Borealis. Have you ever been on vacation there?
<<set $dirtyTourist to react("value", "dirtyTourist", "Esther")>>
<<if $dirtyTourist eq false>>
    Good.
<<else>>
    ............
<<endif>>
Borealis is the kind of place only idiots visit.
Year after year, the native population is asking
for tourists to stop coming over.
You know we can't sustain ourselves in our own 
region anymore? 
We've become dependent on tourism. It's killing
the land and it's commercializing our traditions.
Me and my family didn't chose to run the Nautilus
because we all loves tourist traps, you know?

I never went there. 
I think there is a big University there?
I wonder what they might teach there.

Me? I'm from Borealis. Born and 
raised in a tourist trap. 
I went to school there. Got my first job there.
At some point I got bored and left.
First only for a summer, where I worked
on one of the Dockers travelling the country.
Then I left for a year, I got paid to 
help on a farm south of here.
Were good times. Now I'm just looking 
for anyone who want to hire me.

My family and I are from Borealis. 
You might have guessed that.
We ran a tourist trap near the beach.
We kind of all drifted apart I fear.
Maybe I should go visit my family sometime?
I only know that my father is still in Borealis.

Oh the tourist-trap? The name was Le Nautilus.
We sold like... seashells and fake gemstones.
Some postcards, cheap jewellery. You know.
Standart stuff for a tourist trap.
I probably shouldn't say 'was'. Like.
My father is still running the place.

You're asking about my father? 
He's the only family member I kinda care about.
He's down there, guarding the good old Nautilus.
We share our passion for long walks, but he always 
insisted that people have to be silent on walks.
I think that kind of makes it boring, no?

Hanging around somwhere in Grandrun.
Probably forgot about her children by now.
I can't blame her. I think she always felt
like settling down wasn't for her. 
My father was devastated when she left,
but really, I can't blame her.
I think my passion for travelling is from her.

Red Square? Oh I guess if you're not in 
seafaring buisness you don't know them.
The four big trader companies. 
My brother's company is a one of them.
His company is called West Current.
I bet you've seen some of their ships.
He's the reason I stopped working with traders.
I'd hate to have to do his dirty work.
