I like the presents...
It's so nice and quiet in here.

Oh? Is someone out there?
I was checking out the presents...
And then I saw this gigantic one...
and I wanted to have a look inside...
and then I fell in...
but I like it in here.
Please don't force me to get out...

    Can you just tell her I'm at the presents?

Ah. Too bad.
<<onnodecomplete Managers>>
This has to be here so the dialogue doesnt end otherwise the dialogue will be over before the command is done and that causes problems.
