... A secret word? Say no more...
I am a true master at guessing secret words...
The word is... secret word... no...
it's... dating app! or maybe... guest list!
... Fino Cherry maybe? or uh... Beef Ball?
I probably guessed wrong with all of these,
but let me give you a great piece of advice:
Every good secret word consists of two words.
That way, it's harder to guess!

Me? I am Schubert Kinse, but all my friends
usually call me Stubi. Oh, why they do that?
BECAUSE... I don't know. A friend of mine once
called me Schubi, and then another one made it
into Stubbi. It was Schuhfach along the way too,
I think they all settled for Stubi eventually.
