My mom? She should be around here somewhere.
Usually when we go somewhere, 
she's close to where the music is.

The DJ? I wanted to talk to him,
He seemed annoyed with me..
He was reading his email instead of working.
So uh, I had a look...
He was texting Jordan, I think?
It didn't seem like wedding buisness.
Interesting email for sure.

Yeah, I saw that the DJ made out 
some secret word in his email.
Sadly he didn't mention the actual word...
He just said that the secret word 
is his favorite food?

Oh ho ho! You wanna know about the email? 
Let me tell you. It sounded so secretive.
Like. If I understood it right, they even
made out a secret word. Like a code word.
But I couldn't read fast enough, to see
the actual word in the mail. But I got far
enough to see, that the secret word is 
the name of DJ's favorite dish!
Come on, admit it! You're really impressed 
with my insane spying skills!

This has to be here so the dialogue doesnt end otherwise the dialogue will be over before the command is done and that causes problems.
