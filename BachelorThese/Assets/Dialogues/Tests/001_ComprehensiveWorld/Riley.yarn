I'm sorry, I can't let anyone in right now.
As of yesterday, this town has become an 
active crime scene. There's been a murder.
........
Oh... Wait a second. 
Are you the inspector HQ sent?
<<if $characterName is not null>>
    Yes, Inspector {$characterName}, right?
    Wonderful to have you here today!

    Okay, great then.
    I will just follow you for around, if you don't mind.

Sorry, if you want to work with me,
I will need your name to check, 
if you are the new inspector.
Talk to me again, if you change your mind.

I would really need your name to check, 
whether you are the new inspector.
<<showicantsay Managers>>
<<displaypromptmenu Managers AllAAA>>
What is your name?
<<set $cantsay to icantsay("Riley", "NotWithoutName")>>
<<set $characterName to react("name", "characterName", "Riley")>>
Okay great. I don't see how this was an issue?

The victim is a woman named Evelyn Garland.
She was stabbed in her house yesterday.
The investigation has only stared today,
so we don't know that much yet.
I'd first recommend questioning the suspects,
that were near her at the time. 
I will follow you around, to aid in your 
investigations, if you don't mind.

Oh, okay. No answer then.
<<onnodecomplete Managers>>
This has to be here so the dialogue doesnt end
otherwise the dialogue will be over before the command is done
and that causes problems.
