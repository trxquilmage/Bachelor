Hi! Uh... Sorry...
You are the fifth person I am asking.
Do you happen to have met somebody
on a ... uh... online dating app...
and did you invite said hypothetical person
to... let's say... a wedding?

So... uh. Are we on a date?
<<set $hasDate to react("value", "hasDate", "Riley")>>
<<if $hasDate eq true>>
    Oh, thank god.
    People were starting to stare at me.
    I don't want to keep you from going in,
    so I will just follow you, okay?
    <<settocompanion Managers Riley>>
<<else>>
    Oh, okay, then.
    Like. I promise, I'm not like.
    Some wedding crasher or like. loitering.

This has to be here so the dialogue doesnt end otherwise the dialogue will be over before the command is done and that causes problems.
