    Your name is Finn, you are here to visit your mother.
    Your mother's name is Evelyn Garland.
    Hello, welcome to Bridgetown!
    <<displaypromptmenu Managers NameAAA>>
    Sorry, could I get your name?
    <<set $characterName to react("name", "characterName", "Riley")>>
    {$characterName}, I am sorry, but I can't let anyone in right now.
    This town has recently become an active crime scene.
    Wait a second. 
    HQ said, they wanted to send a new inspector.
    <<displaypromptmenu Managers GenAAA>>
    Yes or No, are you the new inspector?
    <<set $isInspector to react("value", "isInspector", "Riley")>>

    Great. So glad to have you here, Inspector {$characterName}.
    <<displaypromptmenu Managers GenAAA>>
    Do you need a quick rundown of the case?
    <<set $needsRundown to react("value", "", "Riley")>>
    <<if $needsRundown>>

        Okay, great then.
        I will just follow you for around, if you don't mind.
        <<settocompanion Managers Riley>>
    <<endif>>
<<else>>
    Oh okay.
    Sorry that was kind of a dumb question, I guess.
    But I am not allowed to let visitors into town.
    <<displaypromptmenu Managers QuestAAA>>
    Is your buiness here important? What are you here for?
    <<set $questInfo to react("name", "characterQuest", "Riley")>>
    <<set $mother to react("Evelyn Garland", "mother", "Riley")>>
    <<if $questInfo eq "VisitHome" and $mother eq "Evelyn Garland">>
        Oh.
        Oh--okay. 
        Uh, would you mind going into town with me?
        <<settocompanion Managers Riley>>
    <<elseif $questInfo eq "VisitHome">>
        Oh you are here to visit home? 
        If you're a local I guess I can let you through,
        but I will need to follow you around.

The victim is a woman named Evelyn Garland.
She was stabbed in her house yesterday.
The investigation has only stared today,
so we don't know that much yet.
I'd first recommend questioning the suspects,
that were near her at the time. 
I will follow you around, to aid in your 
investigations, if you don't mind.
