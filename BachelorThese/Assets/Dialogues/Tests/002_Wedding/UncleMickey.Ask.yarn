Oh, everything here is great.
There's sushi and wine, but most of the dishes 
are dim sum dishes - a type of chinese specialties.
There's vegan, meaty dishes, sweet dishes...
If you're not familiar with chinese cuisine, 
I'd recommend that you start with the fried tofu!

title: UncleMickey.Vegan
tags:

Finding out what is vegan can be tricky,
because there is a lot of dough involved.
But I would recommend that you try the
fried tofu, pineapple bun and
over there is sticky rice in a lotus leaf.
There's vegan sushi, too!

title: UncleMickey.SweetDishes

You want something sweet?
I'd recommend the pineapple bun!
The DJ's been staring at them the whole day. 
Poor guy. I'll get him some later.
You should also try the turnip cake, 
Oh, and the egg tart!
===

title: UncleMickey.MeatyDishes
tags:
---
Something with meat? 
Oh there's some good stuff here!
Over there you should start with the
BBQ pork Bun, there is a great beef ball.
Over here we have chicken feet, 
definetly try the chopped pork ribs.
Also there's shu mai and shrimp dumplings.

It's a Fino Sherry!

You might think that beef balls are the same as
local meat balls and meat loafs, but they do differ!
It is common in chinese cuisine to pound the
beef until it more or less is pulverized,
which gives it a wholly different texture!

...Oh, yes! 
I am so sorry, I am just throwing around words!
Dim sum describes types of dishes that are 
commonly served around chinese brunch! 
They popularly go with teas and are served around noon,
which are not the conditions we are eating them under,
but I promise, you will still enjoy them!
You might actually know spring rolls, which are
widely served in asian restaurants around the world!
