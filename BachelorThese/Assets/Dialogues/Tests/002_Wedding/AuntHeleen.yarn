Where is he, again...
.... Oh, you're here!
I'm so sorry to bother you with this, but 
if you see Matheo somewhere, could you 
<<setquest Managers QuestAAA>>
tell me where you saw him?
I mean you're gonna talk to a lot of people 
here, could you try asking around?

Ah. Too bad.

This has to be here so the dialogue doesnt end otherwise the dialogue will be over before the command is done and that causes problems.
