Matheo? Who's that?
Oh, a small kid? Yeah...
He was here... Was a bit of a nosy kid... 
Tried to read my messages, while i wasn't looking.
I distracted him. Said, he should go check the presents.

Don't try to get me any pizza to eat.
I know you think it's funny.
I <i>know</i> that you wanted to ask me that.
People hire me for pizza parties all the time.
I don't even like pizza that much.
It's just memorable and sells well.

Do you know how hard it is to get musical equipment
into the middle of the woods? The DJ pult is being 
powered by a generator in my car. It's exhausting.
And there's tons of bugs here, too! Amazing!

No. I did it on purpose. 
I do not want my whole life to be a pizza joke. 
I am an actual human person, who has to live every day 
of his life as "the pizza guy", just so I can make a 
living for myself. I hate it.
I want to live without having to sell out my basic humanity
and be ridiculed by children, be my most fun gigs be funerals,
just because I'm just an unsuccessful DJ, you know?
