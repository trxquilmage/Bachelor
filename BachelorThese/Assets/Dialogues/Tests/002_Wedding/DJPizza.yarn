I'm the DJ for the evening.
DJ Pizza, known for weddings, funerals and
children's parties.
So, if you're throwing one of those, 
be sure to call me! Yay... 
Say... what is your name?

What is the secret word we made out?

    You think that's funny, huh? 
    The joke isn't even good.

His name is Parker. 
Try to get him a bigger Aquarium, 
as soon as you can.
I already got your payment, so...
<<setquest Managers QuestAAD>>

This has to be here so the dialogue doesnt end otherwise the dialogue will be over before the command is done and that causes problems.
