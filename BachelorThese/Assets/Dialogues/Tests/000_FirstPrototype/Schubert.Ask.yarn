Its just very hard to reach from here.

Grandrun? 
I went for a temple tour there once. 
It's quite charming.

Are those the masks from Grandrun?
Saw some when I was there. They are kind of disturbing.
I didn't remember the name, though.

Yup, that's me. Born and raised in Mayfair.
I get out of town sometimes to trade,

Did Fiona tell you about this?
Yeah. Okay. I don't really want to talk about that.
I feel like you don't have any buisness knowing about that, okay?
