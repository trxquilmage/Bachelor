My mom? She should be around here somewhere.
Usually when we go somewhere, 
she's close to where the music is.

The DJ? I wanted to talk to him,
He seemed annoyed with me..
He was reading his email instead of working.
So uh, I had a look...
He was texting Jordan. I didn't know that
Jordan was one of the wedding planners.
Interesting email for sure.

Yeah, I saw that the DJ made out 
some secret word in his email.
Sadly he didn't mention the actual word...
He just said that the secret word 
is his favorite food?
