Hahaha the wedding is amazing.
Hahaha....
Oh... hey...
We don't know each other, I think.
Such a great party, huh?
<<displaypromptmenu Managers GenAAA>>
Did you know that I paid for all of this?
<<set $didKnow to react("value", "", "Minnie")>>
<<if $didKnow>>
    Good! Hahaha...
<<else>>
    You should, though... Hahaha
<<endif>>
But don't worry!
Since I'm Renna's richest friend,
it's really not a problem.

<<elseif $gotPresentValue eq "expensive">>

This has to be here so the dialogue doesnt end otherwise the dialogue will be over before the command is done and that causes problems.
