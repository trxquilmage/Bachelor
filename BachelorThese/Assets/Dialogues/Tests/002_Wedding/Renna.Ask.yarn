Auntie? She's having her fun over there.
I made sure to buy more wine for the buffet,
than the caterer had recommended. Hahaha.

He helped us pick the caterer. 
We don't have much of a clue about food.
And he taught us a lot about chinese cuisine,
James' mom is chinese, that's why I made the choice.
His parents aren't here yet, but I hope she likes it too.
She'll probably still find a reason to nag me.

The DJ? I have to admit, he came pretty cheap.
We got him a pizza as a joke,

Said he was vegetarian. I feel a bit insensitive now.
