I've been anticipating the wedding
for weeks now. You see, the food 
at the Buffet was catered by 
my favorite caterer of all time. 
If you want to try some of the food,
I've tried everything at least once.
So if you need an opinion or anything,
just ask away!

This has to be here so the dialogue doesnt end otherwise the dialogue will be over before the command is done and that causes problems.
