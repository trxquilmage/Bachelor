Where is he, again...
.... Oh, you're here!
I'm so sorry to bother you with this, dear,
but if you see Matheo somewhere, could you 
<<setquest Managers QuestAAA>>
tell me where you saw him?
If you're gonna talk to the other guests, 
could you take a second to ask them about Matheo?

This has to be here so the dialogue doesnt end otherwise the dialogue will be over before the command is done and that causes problems.
