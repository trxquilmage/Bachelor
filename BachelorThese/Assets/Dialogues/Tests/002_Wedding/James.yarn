Hey! I'm so glad you could make it!
<<set $hasDate to getinfo("hasDate", 0)>>
<<if $hasDate>>
    And I see you've brought someone along!
    <<showicantsay Managers>>
    <<displaypromptmenu Managers AdjAAA>>
    How is your date going?
    <<set $cantsay to icantsay("James", "Tour")>>
    <<set $dateIsGoing to react("value", "dateIsGoing", "James")>>
    <<if $dateIsGoing eq "positive">>
        Great! I hope you two have a good night!
    <<elseif $dateIsGoing eq "neutral">>
        Ah, okay then. I hope it gets better.
    <<elseif $dateIsGoing eq "negative">>
        Oh, that doesn't sound good...
        Well... uh... anyway.
    <<endif>>
<<else>>
    I hope the venue wasn't too hard to find.
    We thought about placing markers, 
    but there were too many possibilites
    from where guests could be coming.
<<endif>>
I hope you enjoy the evening!

You haven't seen Jordan yet, have you?
I guess he's always late, huh?

Help yourself at the Buffet, and have 
a seat at one of the tables.
There should be enough space for everyone.
And if you haven't yet, you can add your 
present to the presents near the entrance!
Since the ceremony is already over,
you can sit on the benches too, 
we don't need them.

Oh, nevermind, then. Anyways,
<<onnodecomplete Managers>>
This has to be here so the dialogue doesnt end otherwise the dialogue will be over before the command is done and that causes problems.
