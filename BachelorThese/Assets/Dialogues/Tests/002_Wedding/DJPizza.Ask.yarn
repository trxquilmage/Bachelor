Matheo? Who's that?
Oh, a small kid? Yeah...
He was here... 
Wanted to do my job for me.
So I distracted him by telling him
to check out the presents.

The food at the buffet looks so good.
If I wouldn't working right now, 
I'd be over there... Trying everything.
Especially the sweet dishes...
They have my favorite dish of all time.

Don't try to get me any pizza to eat.
I know you think it's funny.
I <i>know</i> that you wanted to ask me that.
People hire me for pizza parties all the time.
I don't even like pizza that much.
It's just memorable and sells well.
