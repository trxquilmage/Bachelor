Oh, everything here is great.
There's sushi and wine
But most dishes are dim sum dishes.
There's vegan stuff in here,
meaty dishes, sweet dishes...
If you're not that familiar with
chinese cuisine, I would recommend 
that you start with the fried tofu!

Finding out what is vegan can be tricky,
because there is a lot of dough involved.
But I would recommend that you try the
fried tofu, pineapple bun and
over there is sticky rice in a lotus leaf.
There's vegan sushi, too!

You want something sweet?
I'd recommend the pineapple bun!
The DJ's been staring at them the whole day. 
Poor guy. I'll get him some later.
You should also try the turnip cake, 
Oh, and the egg tart!

The wine pairs amazing with the dim sum!
It's a Fino Sherry!

This has to be here so the dialogue doesnt end otherwise the dialogue will be over before the command is done and that causes problems.
