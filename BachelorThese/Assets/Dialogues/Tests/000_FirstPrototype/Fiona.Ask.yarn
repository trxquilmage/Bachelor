    Oh, I remember you from when you were a kid living here.
    You have quite grown up, I would say.
    The town has changed little since then,
    so I hope you feel right at home.
<<else>>
    Mayfair is like any other small town in the countryside.
    We have a few stores, a tavern. 
    And a tour guide for some reason.
    So if you need anything specific, talk to Karl.

Neverre is quite lively this season, I hear. 
The annual mushroom festival is happening there right now.
You know, before it's too cold for mushrooms.

A nice place, I hear. 
I really don't like beaches, though.
However, they do have the most amazing food.

Oh, a Mukhosha? 
Those are the clay masks the indegenous people use there.
They are actually quite macabre... but I really like them.
I hear they are very expensive though.

Karl is actually really nice, when you get to know him better.
He is not very considerate with what he says most of the time.

Oh, me? I was born in Mayfair. 
Lived as a maid for a while in Neverre.
People don't really remember me from when I was little.
I was a very shy kid...
So most people assume, I only moved here.

Schubert is kind of a sweetheart. 
He just. Carries a lot of sadness with him.
He lost someone that meant a lot to him, while travelling.
I think her name was Rebecca.

Like, I said. Schubert knew her.
I, hovever, don't know much more than the name.
And that she's dead.
