Such a great party, hm?
We don't know each other, do we?
I'm Stubi, very pleased to meet you!
So... 
Let's talk buisness...
<<displaypromptmenu Managers GenAAA>>
Do you like treasures?
<<set $likesTreasures to react("value", "", "Stubi")>>
<<if $likesTreasures>>
    Good!
    What is a life without hunting treasures!
<<else>>
    Oh, you just say that!
    Who doesn't love hunting for treasure!
<<endif>>
But don't worry!
We can go on a treasure hunt together.

I want you to talk to the people here... 
And find out, what the most expensive present is,
that someone got for the couple!
<<setquest Managers QuestAAE>>
Oh? What we do once we have that information?
Don't worry about that! *wink*

So... Have you found out about the treasure...
<<showicantsay Managers>>
<<displaypromptmenu Managers ItemAAC>>
Err... I mean... the presents?
<<set $cantsay to icantsay("Stubi", "WontTell")>>
<<set $gotPresentName to react("name", "", "Stubi")>>
<<set $gotPresentValue to react("value", "gotPresentValue", "Stubi")>>
<<if $gotPresentValue eq "cheap">>
    {$gotPresentName}? ...
    Hm. That is not very impressive.
    I mean... it costs almost nothing.
    You should keep searching...
<<elseif $gotPresentValue eq "moderate">>
    {$gotPresentName}? I mean...
    That's cool, but really, it doesn't seem too special. 
    You should keep looking...
<<elseif $gotPresentValue eq "expensive">>
    ... Wow. Okay now *that* is a cool present.
    ........

This has to be here so the dialogue doesnt end otherwise the dialogue will be over before the command is done and that causes problems.
