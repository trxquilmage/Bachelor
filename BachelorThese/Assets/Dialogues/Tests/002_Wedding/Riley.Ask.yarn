Ha ha ha, yeah. My car workshop.
My dad founded the place. Now I run it.
Not the most interesting job in the world,

Greybell, hm? 
<<displaypromptmenuask Managers GenAAA>>
Have you ever been there?
<<set $beenToGreybell to react("value", "", "Riley")>>
<<if $beenToGreybell is true>>
    Oh, you have? Not much there, hm?
    If your car ever gets stuck nearby,
    you can always call Rensgate Car Services.
    Given that this date goes well,
    otherwise that will be akward.
<<else>>
    You haven't, then? Not much to see.
    I like to call it the "world's most
    average place".
    But hey, if your car ever breaks down,
    be sure to call Rensgate Car Services.
    Given that this date goes well,
    otherwise that will be akward.

My father? We're from Greybell,
my dad ran a small workshop for cars there.
It wasn't super successful or anything.
But I liked hanging out there as a kid.

Oh, talking about myself?
I'm not so good at that.
I'm an engineer from Greybell.
My father also was an engineer,
so I thought, "Hey, why not do that too?".
Yeah, I'm not the risk-taking type, I think.

It's been one confusing car ride to get here.
Like. At first I thought the wedding might be a ruse
for you to lure me in the woods and kill me there.
I think I'm really stupid for actually going,
even though it turns out you are not a serial killer.
